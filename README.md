# About

This is my attempt at writing a reference implementation of a browser. I am mainly doing it to learn about browser internals.

# Interested?

I am attempting to outline my thought process in the issues, and answer my own questions with pull requests. If you'd like to 
learn how I am progressing through the spec, take a look at the issues in chronological order.

# Goals

The spec isn't written in the best order for implementors, so this is my attempt at giving myself some structure for my priority of 
features to get a working implementation.

1. [ ] HTML Parser (https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#parsing)
  * [ ] Tokenization (https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/parsing.html#tokenization)
  * [ ] Tree Construction (https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/parsing.html#tree-construction)
